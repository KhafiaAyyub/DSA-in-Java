HashMaps
-> It allows to store the null keys as well, but there should be only one null key object and there can 
be any number of null values.This class makes no guarantees as to the order of the map.

//HashMaps is used solve the problem in O(1) Constant time.
Example:- Population map
//It is used to update,insert the data.
//You cannot control where they would get inserted ->out of order

//It takes two parameters namely as follows:
1.The type of keys maintained by this map
2.The type of mapped values


Syntax:
HashMap<K, V> hm = new HashMap<K, V>();

//The methods are:-
1.get() -> to get the value
2.put() -> insert the value
3.ContainsKey() -> returns the true /false
